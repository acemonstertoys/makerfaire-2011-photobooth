Various stuff, possibly for our Makerfaire 2011.

This is highly unorganized right now, and started out as a collection
of stuff that Cliff and Andreas are working on.


## The Idea

Imagine you're attending Maker Faire 2011.  Attracted by the magnetism of pure
awesomeness, you make a beeline to the Ace Monster Toys booth.

There you discover a large box, claiming to be a Photo Booth...but the screen
out front shows what looks like a rotating model of a head.  How odd!

You step inside the booth and press a button.  A screen lights up, showing a
3D model of your head in profile.  It tells you to center your profile within
a circular outline, superimposed on your head.  A few seconds later, something
goes "bong!" and you step out.

A few feet to your left, a 3D printer hums to life.  The friendly operator
suggests that you check out the rest of the booth while your souvenir comes to
life, but you hang out and watch.

Over the next few minutes, the friendly robots create a customized coin.  On
the back is the AMT logo and some (hard to read) commemorative text.  But on the
face...is, well, your face, in profile, doing your best George Washington.

You leave holding a little piece of the future, and a promise that if you stop
by the space and show your coin, we will...something.  At least say hello!  So
of course you head to Oakland and become a member.

## Technical Constraints

MakerBots are slow, and people have short attention spans.  The coins must be
fast to print --- say, no more than 10 minutes.  This means they'll have to be
quite thin, with only a couple layers for face detail.  (This is why it's a
profile shot: they're easier to recognize by outline alone.)

Pieces we can pull together:

* Cliff has an open-source library for capturing, processing, displaying, and
  manipulating data from the Kinect.  He also has a Kinect.
* There are some MakerBots around that we might be able to rope in.  More
  MakerBots means more throughput.  (Thought: reach out to MakerBot Industries.
  This would be great advertising for them....)
* We'll need a few trained operators.
